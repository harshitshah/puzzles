Two players (0 and 1) are playing a game. Player 0 starts first. There are n coins on the table; each
player can only pick 1, 2 or 4 coins from the table when it is his turn. Note that a player can never
pick more coins than there are on the table. Last person to pick all the coins remaining on the table wins.
Each player is rational and can compute all possible moves the other player might make.

For a given number of coins, find out which player wins and in how many ways.
